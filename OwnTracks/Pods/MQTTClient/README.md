### Usage

Create a new client and connect to a broker:

MQTTSession *session = [[MQTTSession alloc]initWithClientId:@"client_id"]

// Set delegate appropriately to receive various events
// See MQTTSession.h for information on various handlers
// you can subscribe to.
[session setDelegate:self];

[session connectAndWaitToHost:@"host" port:1883 usingSSL:NO];

```

Subscribe to a topic:

```objective-c
[session subscribeToTopic:topic atLevel:MQTTQosLevelAtLeastOnce];
```

Publish a message to a topic:

```objective-c
[session publishAndWaitData:data
	                onTopic:@"topic"
	                 retain:NO
				        qos:MQTTQosLevelAtLeastOnce]
